# TESTsbm: Bayesian testing for exogenous partition structures in stochastic block models

This repository is associated with the article [**Bayesian testing for exogenous partition structures in stochastic block models**](https://github.com/danieledurante/TESTsbm) and aims at providing detailed materials and codes implement the inference and testing methods presented in the article.

The documentation is organized in two main parts described below.  

- [`Data and Codes`](https://github.com/danieledurante/TESTsbm/tree/master/Data%20and%20Codes).  It contains [i] useful data to reproduce the [`Tutorial.md`](https://github.com/danieledurante/TESTsbm/blob/master/Tutorial.md) and [ii] commented source `R` functions in [`TESTsbm.R`](https://github.com/danieledurante/TESTsbm/blob/master/Data%20and%20Codes/TESTsbm.R) to implement the inference and testing methods presented in the article.

- [`Tutorial.md`](https://github.com/danieledurante/TESTsbm/blob/master/Tutorial.md). It contains a comprehensive tutorial to perform inference and testing leveraging the methods and algorithms presented in the article and implemented in the source code [`TESTsbm.R`](https://github.com/danieledurante/TESTsbm/blob/master/Data%20and%20Codes/TESTsbm.R). To accomplish this goal, we reproduce step-by-step the simulation study in the article.

The analyses are performed with a **MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6)**, using a `R` version **3.6.3**. 

All the above functions rely on a **basic and reproducible `R` implementation**, mostly meant to provide a clear understanding of the computational routines and steps associated with the proposed model. **Optimized computational routines relying on C++ coding can be easily considered.** 

The **Alzheimerâ€™s networks** considered in the application are openly available in the supplementary files of the article  [**Predicting brain network changes in Alzheimer's disease with link prediction algorithms**](https://doi.org/10.1039/C6MB00815A).
